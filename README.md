# Zed Portable Windows Build 

**Portable Windows Build of the Modern Zed Editor (unofficial build for personal use)**



## 📋 About

This repository provides a **portable Windows version** of the modern [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor developed by [Zed Industries](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed). 

The goal is to offer a convenient, **portable binary** that can be used without the need for installation.

Zed Editor is a high-performance, collaborative, and minimal text editor optimized for developers. My contribution is simply repackaging it as a standalone binary for Windows.
