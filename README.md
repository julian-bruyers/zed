## Why Archived?

This repository previously offered an **unofficial portable Windows build** of the modern [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor for convenience.  
Since **official Windows releases** are available from Zed Industries, maintaining a separate unofficial build is no longer necessary.

Please use the **official downloads** going forward:
- üåê **Zed Downloads (Windows, macOS, Linux):** https://zed.dev/download
- üíª **Zed Industries on GitHub:** https://github.com/zed-industries/zed

## What Was Here

- A **portable binary** of Zed for Windows (no installation required).
- Optional personal **configuration/keybindings** in the `config/` folder.
- A selection of personal **themes** in the `themes/` folder (credits inside the respective `*.json` files).

These historical artifacts may remain visible in Releases but will **not** be updated.
